# plan2event-stripe-v2

**Live:** https://plan2event-stripe-v2.cycls.ai

Attach a venue DXF and describe an event. You get the same DXF back with the
event laid out in it — stages, tents, toilets, food, generators, fences — as
real CAD blocks at real metric coordinates, on their own `EVENT-*` layers so
the client's drawing is never touched.

This repository is **one agent**: the **Stripe** placement engine,
**v2** variant.

## How it places things

Deterministic geometric striping. No solver and no search: rotate the site to its own grain, set back from the edges, subtract what is already there, stripe the remainder into rows, fill them, sweep the angle and keep the best. The only engine whose output reads as designed rows — a line of food trucks, a bank of toilets — rather than as a legal scatter.

Method after ucalyptus/ParkSolver (MIT). Measured on a real 7.5 MB venue masterplan with a
25-item programme: **25/25 placed, 0 violations, 2.6 s**.

## v2

Everything v1 does, plus four things. The model reads two reference files shipped in `reference/` — provisioning figures from FEMA IS-15 and site-design rules. It follows composition rules in the prompt. It must cite a source for every regulatory number or say it assumed it. And it may never draw an object in place of a catalogue block. Then, after it stops, the plan is rendered beside the venue as supplied, reviewed as an event-operations professional would, and revised — twice.

The v1 of this engine is [plan2event-stripe](https://github.com/Eli-AMAR/plan2event-stripe).

## The idea every engine shares

**The model never chooses coordinates.** It decides what the event needs and
how the pieces relate; the engine decides where, choosing only from positions
already proved to fit against the real free-space polygon of the drawing.
Holodeck, LayoutVLM, DirectLayout and I-Design all split the work this way. The
agent it replaces, [agent-2d-to-2d-not](https://github.com/Eli-AMAR/agent-2d-to-2d-not),
did the opposite: it asked an image model to imagine the finished site and read
positions back off the picture.

## Layout

```
agent.py         the agent — deploys exactly this one
core/            DXF reading, free space, the catalogue, placement, the tool
                 surface, the prompt, the model driver
engines/stripe.py   the placement method
reference/       two files the v2 prompt tells the model to read
assets/          the catalogue: 3 650 usable blocks, normalised to metres
tools/           harness.py, and the scripts that built the catalogue
docs/            transcript.md — the full conversation that built this
CLAUDE.md        the handover: decisions, and the bugs each one cost
```

## Run it

Python 3.12.

```bash
pip install ezdxf "shapely>=2.0" numpy scipy matplotlib pygeoops
python tools/make_site.py            # writes a synthetic 120 x 90 m venue
python tools/harness.py              # or: python tools/harness.py your_venue.dxf
```

The harness places a fixed programme with this engine, validates it and writes
`harness_stripe.png` next to the plan. No model, no deployment, no keys — and
with `make_site.py`, no client drawing either.

## Deploy it

```bash
pip install cycls==0.0.2.140
cp .env.example .env        # fill in the three keys
python agent.py deploy
```

`.env` needs `CYCLS_API_KEY`, `FAL_KEY` (image hosting for the renders shown in
the chat) and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (from `claude setup-token`).
**Leave `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` empty.** The model runs through the Claude Code CLI
on a subscription; if the API key is present the CLI silently prefers it and
bills per token.

## Why it is built this way

Read `CLAUDE.md` for the state of the work and the traps already paid for —
negative site coordinates that made a solver silently infeasible, a unit
header nobody was reading, an inches-to-feet conversion factor. Read
`docs/transcript.md` for the conversation in which each of those was found.
